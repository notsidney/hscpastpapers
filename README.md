# [HSCPastPapers.com](https://hscpastpapers.com/)

## Shutting down on 20 October 2025

I built HSCPastPapers.com in 2017 while procrastinating studying for the rest of my HSC exams.
It was built to make the experience of finding and browsing past HSC exam papers much easier
compared to the NESA website at the time, including showing the exam PDFs in an iframe, until
[NESA requested that be removed in 2018](./copyright-changes.md).

Now that NESA has updated their website with improved navigation and search, and
[changed the URLs](https://github.com/notsidney/hscpastpapers/issues/34)
to exam paper PDFs, there isn’t a good reason to continue spending time and money to keep this
up to date.

If you’re looking for past HSC exam papers,
[visit the official NESA website ↗](https://www.nsw.gov.au/education-and-training/nesa/curriculum/hsc-exam-papers)

You can view archived versions of HSCPastPapers.com on the [Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine ↗](https://web.archive.org/web/https://hscpastpapers.com/)
